# Scriptable Objects, Explained

In this tutorial respository you'll learn about a hugely powerful tool provided to us by Unity, ScriptableObjects. Many beginners in Unity (myself included!) don't understand what these are and just completely disregard them.

You'll learn about how to create them, what kinds of data can be put into them, what else they can do, and some real-life use cases for them!
